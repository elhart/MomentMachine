	- the view takes images form /public/images
			 javascript from /public/javascripts

	- the view supports three screen sizes: small(600x1080), big(1320x1080), and fullscreen(1920x1080)
- Routs configuration - /conf/routs
	- app can be called in a web browser: localhost:9000/?id=5&size=big
- Application configuration file /conf/application.conf
